## TaskJam ðŸª©

This is a simple, yet vibrant Todo List application built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. The project was implemented following a tutorial from [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-code-your-react-app-with-typescript/). It was a great way to brush up on the basics of Tailwind CSS and TypeScript with React.
